- There have been 30 contributors to this project.
- The core team seems to have stayed fairly up until recently.
- Cory Boyd is the lead developer for this project.

- All participation ended for almost 6 months, and is only just now starting to pick back up.

- There doesn't seem to be any straight on-boarding process.
- The project has some documentation but nothing to help a newbie jump in.
- Currently it is ruled by a pair of individuals, David Rappo and Warren Konkel.
