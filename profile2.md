# Community Architecture

Your subject likely runs or contributes to one or more Open Source products or projects. Choose one (or more) of these and answer the following questions:

---

- irc://irc.freenode.net/#beagle
- [Source Code](https://github.com/beagleboard/linux)
- [Forums](http://beagleboard.org/Community/Forums/)
- [Documentation](http://beagleboard.org/getting-started)
- [Project Website](http://beagleboard.org/)

---

- Provides a kernel for BeagleBoard and BeagleBone devices
- Repository is large enough that it defies analysis

---

- Encorporates the Linux kernel
- Large number of contributors as a result, but few pull requests for the repository itself
- This repository's main differences are the BeagleBone specific drivers, etc

---

- Documentation for submitting patches is from the original Linux kernel
	- Uses upstream changes, but non-upstream contributions must be BeagleBone-specific
- Hierarchical, one component of mainline Linux development


# Technology/Product

## Beaglebone Boards

- Beagleboardorg has created several “boards” that are typically used in embedded Linux applications.
- Their current most popular board is the BeagleBone Black which is based off of an ARM chipset and runs Linux.
- The BeagleBone Black can be expanded by things called “Capes” which are attachments that can provide various additional functionality.
- Their older boards are the BeagleBoard, Beagleboard XM, and the BeagleBone.
- Over the years due to embedded technology getting better, their products have gotten cheaper and more powerful.
