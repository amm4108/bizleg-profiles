## Rationale

We chose the Beaglebone organization as lots of us have used either one of their products or a similar product like the Raspberry Pi.
It's a really cool company that has lots of potential for helping people get really cool embedded projects off the ground.

## Conference Participation

- Beagleboard maintains a list of conferences as well as what was presented here. [Slideshows](<http://beagleboard.org/show/>)
- Typically the conferences have to do with embedded Linux applications and the talks are given by various people in the Beagleboard community.
- Some of the conferences they have presentations at are:
- [Embedded Linux Conference](<http://beagleboard.org/show/elc2015/>)
- [Maker Faire Bay Area](<http://beagleboard.org/show/makerfairebayarea2015/>)
- [SCALE](<http://beagleboard.org/show/scale2015/>)


# Community Architecture

---

- irc://irc.freenode.net/#beagle
- [Source Code](https://github.com/beagleboard/linux)
- [Forums](http://beagleboard.org/Community/Forums/)
- [Documentation](http://beagleboard.org/getting-started)
- [Project Website](http://beagleboard.org/)

---

- Provides a kernel for BeagleBoard and BeagleBone devices
- Repository is large enough that it defies analysis

---

- Encorporates the Linux kernel
- Large number of contributors as a result, but few pull requests for the repository itself
- This repository's main differences are the BeagleBone specific drivers, etc

---

- Documentation for submitting patches is from the original Linux kernel
	- Uses upstream changes, but non-upstream contributions must be BeagleBone-specific
- Hierarchical, one component of mainline Linux development


# Technology/Product

## Beaglebone Boards

- Beagleboardorg has created several "boards" that are typically used in embedded Linux applications.
- Their current most popular board is the BeagleBone Black which is based off of an ARM chipset and runs Linux.
- The BeagleBone Black can be expanded by things called "Capes" which are attachments that can provide various additional functionality.
- Their older boards are the BeagleBoard, Beagleboard XM, and the BeagleBone.
- Over the years due to embedded technology getting better, their products have gotten cheaper and more powerful.

## Callaway Coefficient of Fail

- Hard to apply to OSHW projects as much of the code written specifically for the project are spread throughout forks of other projects.
