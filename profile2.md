## Rationale

We wanted to cover the Linux Foundation due to all of us having extensive knowledge using Linux. We wanted to know more about what they do due to our use of Linux. We all kind of chose at the same time and all agreed just because we all wanted to know more.

# Technology/Product

## Beaglebone Boards

- Beagleboardorg has created several “boards” that are typically used in embedded Linux applications.
- Their current most popular board is the BeagleBone Black which is based off of an ARM chipstet and runs Linux.
- The BeagleBone Black can be expanded by things called “Capes” which are attachments that can provide various additional functionality.
- Their older boards are the BeagleBoard, Beagleboard XM, and the BeagleBone.
- Over the years due to embedded technology getting better, their products have gotten cheaper and more powerful.
