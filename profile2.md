# Community Architecture

Your subject likely runs or contributes to one or more Open Source products or projects. Choose one (or more) of these and answer the following questions:

---

- If applicable, list and provide links to:
	- The project's IRC Channel
	- Source Code repository
	- Mail list archive
	- Documentation
	- Other communication channels
	- Project Website and/or Blog

---

- Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.
- Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?

---

- Who approves patches? How many people?
- Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?
- Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)
- Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)
- Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?

---

- What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?
- How is the project's participation trending and why?
- In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?
- In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?

---

- Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)
- Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?
- If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?

---

- Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?
- Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?


# Technology/Product

## Beaglebone Boards

- Beagleboardorg has created several “boards” that are typically used in embedded Linux applications.
- Their current most popular board is the BeagleBone Black which is based off of an ARM chipstet and runs Linux.
- The BeagleBone Black can be expanded by things called “Capes” which are attachments that can provide various additional functionality.
- Their older boards are the BeagleBoard, Beagleboard XM, and the BeagleBone.
- Over the years due to embedded technology getting better, their products have gotten cheaper and more powerful.
