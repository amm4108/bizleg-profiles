<li><code>Github and Government</code> is a website dedicated to sharing open government efforts that involve Github</li>
<li>Started January 20, 2013, most recent commit March 5, 2015</li>
<li>Two people (<a href="https://github.com/benbalter">benbalter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jlord">jlord</a>) accept all of the <a href="https://github.com/github/government.github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">pull requests</a></li>

<li>Development has been active throughout its lifetime</li>
<li>The project would continue fine if one of the two main devs were eaten by a velociraptor

<h1>The Technology Behind GitHub</h1>
<p>GitHub is powered completely by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29">Git</a>, a distributed source control system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Git was originally started by Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernel.</li>
<li>Git was initially started to track the Linux kernel and was then used by other projects.</li>
<li>Lots of people interested in working on the same set of files or tracking changes in files could potentially use Git.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29"></a></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="github-using-git" class="slide level2">
<h1>GitHub Using Git</h1>
<ul>
<li>Created to be a highly distributed SCM, GitHub based their entire product on using Git.</li>
<li>GitHub now uses git as the tool it uses to track most of their repos and interface with GitHub.</li>
<li>Contrary to popular belief, Git existed before GitHub. GitHub created a nice visual front end and a great central area for code repos.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="copyright-law-and-creation-of-git" class="slide level2">
<h1>Copyright Law and Creation of Git</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Linux kernel was originally tracked in BitKeeper, a properitary SCM.</li>
<li>Devs of BitKeeper resciended license to use it and the kernel was left in the cold.</li>
<li>Linus became fed up and created his own that would be FOSS so that incident could never happen again.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="controversy-over-github-and-copyright" class="slide level2">
<h1>Controversy over GitHub and Copyright</h1>
<ul>
<li>GitHub is not open source, leading to an ironic situation that one of the most central sites for FOSS software isn’t FOSS itself.</li>
<li>GitHub also has a default license that has been controversial over some of its terms.</li>
