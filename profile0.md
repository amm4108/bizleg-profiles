## Rationale

All of us use GitHub frequently, so we wanted to learn more about it since it's so widely used by all sorts of hackers.

# Organizational Details

---

- Is the subject of your profile a corporate entity?
- What type?
- When was it founded?
- By whom?
- Original founder(s) still active?

---

- Publicly Traded? Since when? Initial Stock Price? Current stock price?
- Has the company made any acquisitions? If yes, which companies, and what were their core products?
- Has the company made any investments in other companies? If yes, which ones.

---

- Number of Employees?
- Where is HQ?
- Does it have any other offices or locations?
- Website?
- Wikipedia?
- Does your organization file any annual reports? Please include links to any relevant documents (i.e. 990, Annual Report, Year in Review, etc...)

# Communications
- Social media for GitHub
    - Twitter: https://twitter.com/github
    - Twitter: https://twitter.com/githubstatus (Downtime report)
    - LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/github
- Communications channels for GitHub
    - GitHub’s press page lists all of their awards that they have received. https://github.com/about/press
    - GitHub also has a blog that has lots of interesting posts. https://github.com/blog
    - They also include a Glossary so writes can better report about what the company does. https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/
- GitHub Conference Participation
    - GitHub hosts “GitHub Universe” which is their own conference about working on open source projects as well as gathering tons of people working in open source. (http://githubuniverse.com/)
    - GitHub also hosts “CodeConf” a two day conference about open source, best practices, documentation, and collaboration. (http://codeconf.com/)

# Community Architecture

## Project Name

- The project's IRC Channel
- Source Code repository
- Mail list archive
- Documentation
- Other communication channels
- Project Website and/or Blog

---

- Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.
- Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?
- Who approves patches? How many people?
- Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?

---

- Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)
- Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)
- Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?
- What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?

---

- How is the project's participation trending and why?
- In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?
- In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?
- Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)

---

- Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?
- If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?

---

- Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?
  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?
- Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?

# Technology/Product (Section adapted from [EFF](EFF) [Worksheet](http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/technology-history-worksheet)

- The Technology Behind GitHub
    - GitHub is powered completely by Git, a distributed source control system.
        - Contrary to popular belief, Git existed before GitHub. GitHub created a nice visual front end and a great central area for code repos.
        - Git was originally started by Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernel. 
        - Created to be a highly distributed SCM, GitHub based their entire product on using Git.
        - Git was initially started to track the Linux kernel and was then used by other projects.
        - GitHub now uses git as the tool it uses to track most of their repos and interface with GitHub.
        - Lots of people interested in working on the same set of files or tracking changes in files could potentially use Git.

---
- Copyright Law and Creation of Git
    - The Linux kernel was originally tracked in BitKeeper, a properitary SCM.
    - Devs of BitKeeper resciended license to use it and the kernel was left in the cold.
    - Linus became fed up and created his own that would be FOSS so that incident could never happen again.
- Controversy over GitHub and Copyright.
    - GitHub is not open source, leading to an ironic situation that one of the most central sites for FOSS software isn’t FOSS itself.
    - GitHub also has a default license that has been controversial over some of its terms.
