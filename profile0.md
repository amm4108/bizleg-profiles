<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>There are <em>so</em> many subjects you could choose to profile, so why did
you choose this one? What drew you into wanting to know more about the
organization? How did you/your group decide on and agree?</p>

<h2>Organizational Details</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Is the subject of your profile a corporate entity?</li>
    <li>What type?</li>
    <li>When was it founded?</li>
    <li>By whom?</li>
    <li>Original founder(s) still active?</li>
    <li>Publicly Traded? Since when? Initial Stock Price? Current stock price?</li>
    <li>Has the company made any acquisitions? If yes, which companies, and what were their core products?</li>
    <li>Has the company made any investments in other companies? If yes, which ones.</li>
    <li>Number of Employees?</li>
    <li>Where is HQ?</li>
    <li>Does it have any other offices or locations?</li>
    <li>Website?</li>
    <li>Wikipedia?</li>
    <li>Does your organization file any annual reports? Please include links to any relevant documents (i.e. 990, Annual Report, Year in Review, etc...)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Communications</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Does your subject participate in social media? If yes, please list a
    URL for each account, and reach within that community. (i.e. <a
    target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/redhatnews">Twitter:
    @RedHatNews</a> - 61.9K Followers.</li>
    <li>What communication channels does your subject use to reach their
    public? Briefly describe and include a URL for each.</li>
    <li>Does your subject organize or participate in any conferences? If so, list them here, and provide links to any relevant sessions, keynotes, or content.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Community Architecture</h2>
<p>Your subject likely runs or contributes to one or more Open Source products
or projects. Choose one (or more) of these and answer the following questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <p>If applicable, list and provide links to:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
        <li>The project's IRC Channel</li>
        <li>Source Code repository</li>
        <li>Mail list archive</li>
        <li>Documentation</li> 
        <li>Other communication channels</li>
        <li>Project Website and/or Blog</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>

    <li>Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.</li>

    <li>
    Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest
    commit?
    </li>

    <li>
    Who approves patches? How many people?
    </li>

    <li>
    Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?
    </li>

    <li>
    Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of
    contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)
    </li>

    <li>
    Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent
    Dictator for Life)
    </li>

    <li>
    Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the
    proportion of each?
    </li>

    <li>
    What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen
    during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?
    </li>

    <li>
    How is the project's participation trending and why?
    </li>

    <li>
    In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the
    project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a
    Velociraptor?) Why or why not?
    </li>

    <li>
    In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active
    20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?
    </li>

    <li>
    Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new
    contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically
    on newbies, etc...)
    </li>

    <li>
    Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it
    include code examples?
    </li>

    <li>
    If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or
    hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?
    </li>

    <li>
    Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making
    structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building,
    ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or
    pair of individuals?
    </li>

    <li>
    Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?
    </li>
</ol>
