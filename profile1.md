## Rationale

We wanted to cover the Linux Foundation due to all of us having extensive knowledge using Linux. We wanted to know more about what they do due to our use of Linux. We all kind of chose at the same time and all agreed just because we all wanted to know more.

# Technology/Product

## Linux

- The Linux Foundation is centered around promoting, standardizing, and protecting Linux.
- Linux is an open source operating system used on tons of platforms ranging from small embedded devices to large clusters of servers.
- Anyone needing a non-realtime operating system kernel could benefit from using Linux.
- Massive amounts of companies have a stake in the Linux kernel as well as the Linux Foundation. There are 185 corporate members of the Linux Foundation.
- One of the main reasons Linux became so popular was that it was open sourced and GPL licensed, which wasnâ€™t common when it was made.
